## A01 - Basic Project Organization
### Ahmed Krubally
### Description:
This assignment is to emphasize the importance of organizing a programming project above and beyond the "code" itself. If someone cannot decipher your code, they rely on comments. If someone cannot run your code, they rely on instructions. If someone wants to use something you wrote in their own project (non academically!) they will rely on good comments, a good description of the project, and good instructions on how to use your project. From my standpoint, I need these things to grade projects with minimal issues. All of this will make more sense as the semester goes on, and you see how we utilize command line parameters and external libraries in our projects.
