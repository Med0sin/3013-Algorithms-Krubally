## P01 - Database Indexes ... What?!? (not really)
### Ahmed Krubally
### Description:
  The purpose of this software is to analyze the performance
of two distinct data structures. The program includes a database 
consisting of eight AVL trees that are optimized for searching various 
types of data, as well as a Singly Linked List. By searching through the 
database and the list, the program measures the duration it takes to complete
 each search and outputs the results on the screen. All data used in this program is 
 extracted from a Json file that contains 100,000 data points.
